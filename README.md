# php2html.bat
Converts your php scripts to static html

# Requirements
Requires php to be installed and added to your PATH.
#### Tip! If you're using XAMPP/WAMP or something similar, you should already have `php.exe` located somewhere on your machine. In my case, it was located in `C:/xampp/php/php.exe`, and as such I added `C:/xampp/php/` to my path.

# Usage
- Place `php2html.bat` in the same folder as your .php-files
- Run the script (double click on it)
- Your files will be outputted in the same folder, using the naming convention `file.php` => `file.html`
